# Selenium Blaze Track

Welcome to the Selenium DemoBlaze Testing repository! This repository is designed to help myself learn Selenium WebDriver and TestNG by testing the DemoBlaze website.

## About DemoBlaze
DemoBlaze is a demo e-commerce website where users can browse and purchase various electronic products such as smartphones, laptops, and accessories. The website provides a realistic testing environment with features like product listings, shopping cart functionality, user registration, and checkout process.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive learning resource for mastering Selenium WebDriver and TestNG through practical exercises and hands-on experience. By testing the DemoBlaze website, I'll gain valuable skills in test automation, web testing, and software quality assurance.

## Features
- **Selenium WebDriver:** Utilize Selenium WebDriver to automate interactions with web elements on the DemoBlaze website.
- **TestNG:** Implement TestNG for test case management, assertion handling, and test reporting.
- **Page Object Model (POM):** Organize your Selenium tests using the Page Object Model design pattern for better code maintainability and reusability.
- **Test Suites:** Create test suites to group related test cases and execute them as a batch.
- **Data-Driven Testing:** Implement data-driven testing to validate different scenarios using various test data sets.
- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Extend your tests to perform cross-browser testing on different web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **Parallel Execution:** Run tests in parallel to reduce execution time and increase efficiency.
- **Reporting:** Generate detailed test reports with TestNG's reporting capabilities to analyze test results.
